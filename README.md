A heuristic approach
is applied where a resistor and a double-layer capacitor in series are connected
with the capacitance relaxations overall in parallel and an RC transmission
line with Warburg-like interfacial impedance in parallel to the double-layer capacitance,
thus making all capacitance effects additive, as in the dielectric spectroscopy.
Only about twenty parameters, determined by an optimization algorithm, heuristically
describe the 173 impedance spectra between 200 and 416K, consolidating into
a single complex capacitance curve. Activation energies of 0.51, 0.57, and 0.92 eV
represent a bulk conduction mechanism, current constriction at grain boundaries,
and electronic conduction, enhanced at grain boundaries and surfaces. Selective ion-blocking
at grain boundaries induces chemical polarization and an additional arc in
the blocking electrode response.
